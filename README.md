# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI  

## 📂 Dataset Source  
I used the **Customer Segmentation dataset** from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/customer-segmentation/input)  

**Size:** ~401k customer records, 8 features  

👉 The raw dataset is available on Kaggle.  
👉 A **cleaned Excel dataset** is included in this repository: `CleanData.xlsx`

## 🎯 Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to understand:  
- Which customers are most likely to churn  
- How churn trends evolve over time  
- Geographic distribution of churned revenue  
- Revenue contribution by RFM segments  
- The impact of RFM scores on churn rate  
- Estimated revenue loss due to churn

## 📊 Final Deliverables  
An **interactive Power BI dashboard** providing insights into:  
- Total customers, churned customers, active customers, and total revenue  
- Customer churn rate and retention rate  
- Average recency, frequency, and monetary values  
- Time series analysis of churned revenue and churn rate  
- Revenue breakdown by churn status and year  
- Customer distribution by RFM segments  
- Revenue breakdown by RFM segment  
- Churn analysis by country and customer segment  
- Impact of RFM scores on churn rate
